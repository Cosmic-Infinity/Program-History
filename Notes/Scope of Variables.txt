macro #define

global variable (avoid)

local varibale


NOTE :	register int i; will save the integer in cpu register. Extremely quick access. but system decides if it 	actually gets stored in a rigister, depending on the current state of the system and availability of 	registers.
	auto int i; this is by default. automatically managed.
	static int i; defined outside the function's scope. and can be accessed by other static data members.
	extern int i; for accessing variable from other files
