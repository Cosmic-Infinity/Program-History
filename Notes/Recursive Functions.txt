A function calling itself is a recursive function.

Must have terminating conditipon (base condition), or else it will run infinitely (or till stack overflow).

C usually DOES NOT show any stack overflow errors. It simply halts (not terminate).


int fact(int n){
	if(n==1)
		return 1;

	return(fact(n-1));
}

recursion requires more memory and cpu cycles.
recursion saves the state of the caller function on the stack while it handles the called function.
recursion is used only if there is an absolute need for it, and is not a substitute for loop.
