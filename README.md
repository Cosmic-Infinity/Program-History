# First Year CP Lab Solutions
Contains solutions of KIIT first year Programming Lab Assignments.

>**NOTE : The sequence of question may change from year to year. Check once before referring.**

All folders named `Day 1, Day 2, ...` are from [PC Lab Manual](https://github.com/Cosmic-Infinity/Programming-Lab-FirstYear/blob/main/PC%20Lab.%20Manual.pdf).

All folders named `Week 11, Week 12, ...` are from [Programming Lab Lesson Plan](https://github.com/Cosmic-Infinity/Programming-Lab-FirstYear/blob/main/Programming%20Lab%20Lessson%20Plan%202024.docx.pdf).


## How to run
Popular IDEs have extensions to recognise and run C code. Though if you are following along with the class and using GNU/Linux to run your code, you can use the simple commands.

`gcc filename.c`

Then running the binary generated in the current directory by

`./a.out`

Remember to read the Lab Manual provided (you can find a copy of it in this repository) and follow the question and the format of expected input. There is no exception handling in this code, beware it will break with weird inputs.

### Remember
There might as well be better/more efficient solutions to these questions. The point here wasn't to write the most efficient C code, but write an easy to understand simple solution. A lot of solutions can be made with bit manipulation, strings, libraries, etc, but remember not all of them are present in this introductory course, and using them might irritate the teacher, which you know...isn't worth it when it's 4 freaking credits we're dealing with.

<i>P.S. I have checked these solutions personally, and they appear to be correct to the best of my knowledge. Though remember, I am only human. And always keep an eye out for misnumbered questions. I am bad with numbers :p</i>
