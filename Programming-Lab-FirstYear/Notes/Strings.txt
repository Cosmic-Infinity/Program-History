There is no data type called string in C.
All we have is charcater array.


char name[20];
scanf("%s",name); //NOTE this will only take the first word, i.e, until the first space. For the full word we will 				need regex.

the end marker of each string is '\0' which is null.

so length finding becomes a manual task with loop. there is no built in function for it.

int i = 0;
while(name[i]!='\0')
	i++;
printf("the length of the string is %d", i);

multiword input by scanset

scanf("%[^n]", &s);
will take input until a newline character is encountered. So spaces will be taken in, and the only instance it will stop is when the \n (enter or newline) isdetected in the string
