for 
while
do-while

To perform a task repeatedly.
Usually a condition check repetedly, based on which a statement gets executed repetedly.
Can be "pre test" or "post test".

suggestion : when number of iterations are known fixed, preferably use for loop. othrewise while.
do-while when we need to run the statement atleast once before condition check.
